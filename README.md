# NovaGames #
The Novagames plugin is an extensible framework for creating and managing minigames and events, wherein each minigame follows the ECS design pattern (each minigame is a collection of MinigameComponents).

The plugin is far from finished, and is not likely to reach completion in any short amount of time.  Development will be sporadic and dependent on the amount of free time available.
